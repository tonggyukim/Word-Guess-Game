# Word-Guess-Game
With the use of JavaScript and basic HTML, I created a game that allows users from our class to guess one of our classmate's names. If they succeed within 9 tries, an alert pops up that tells them that they've won. If they don't, an alert pops up that tells them they lost. Once the game is over, a new game is able to be played.
